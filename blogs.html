            Wikipedia is an online free-content encyclopedia project helping to
            create a world in which everyone can freely share in the sum of all
            knowledge. It is supported by the Wikimedia Foundation and based on
            a model of openly editable content. The name "Wikipedia" is a
            blending of the words wiki (a technology for creating collaborative
            websites, from the Hawaiian word wiki, meaning "quick") and
            encyclopedia. Wikipedia's articles provide links designed to guide
            the user to related pages with additional information.

            Creatine was first identified in 1832 when Michel Eugène Chevreul
            isolated it from the basified water-extract of skeletal muscle. He
            later named the crystallized precipitate after the Greek word for
            meat, κρέας (kreas). In 1928, creatine was shown to exist in
            equilibrium with creatinine.[3] Studies in the 1920s showed that
            consumption of large amounts of creatine did not result in its
            excretion. This result pointed to the ability of the body to store
            creatine, which in turn suggested its use as a dietary supplement.
